<p>
  Heroic is an open-source monitoring system originally built at
  <a href="https://spotify.com">Spotify</a> to address the problems that were
  facing with large scale gathering and near real-time analysis of metrics.
</p>

<p>
  Heroic's main features are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>An architecture that scales with you, large or small.</li>
  <li>Indefinite retention, as long as you have the hardware spend.</li>
  <li>A rich <a ui-sref="^.query_language">query and filtering language</a>, driven by Elasticsearch.</li>
  <li><a ui-sref="^.federation">Federation support</a> to connect multiple Heroic clusters into a global interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Heroic uses a small set of components which are responsible for very specific things.
</p>

<h3>Consumers</h3>

<p>
  Consumers are the component responsible for <em>consuming</em> metrics.
</p>

<p>
  We support consuming over <a ui-sref="^.config.consumer({'#': 'kafka'})">Kafka</a>, the <a ui-sref="^.config.consumer({'#': 'collectd'})">collectd protocol</a>, and over <a ui-sref="^.api({'#': 'post-write'})">HTTP</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Out of these options, Kafka is the preferred one since it allows for a discovery-free architecture due to it being a pub-sub system.
  It has proven to be horizontally scalable and resilient towards failures.
</p>

<p>
  The following tutorials are available for configuring consumers:

</ul>

<h3>Metrics</h3>

<p>
  Metric storage can be handled by either Google Cloud Bigtable or Apache Cassandra.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/">Google Cloud Bigtable</a> is a
  fully-managed petabyte-scale NoSQL database. It's the same database that
  powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and
  Gmail. Bigtable has inspired the design of many other NoSQL databases, such as
  Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra.
</p>

<p>
  The technique for storing time series data in Cassandra is described in
  <a href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/advanced-time-series-with-cassandra">Advanced Time Series with Cassandra</a>.
  It was inspired by how it's implemented in
  <a href="http://kairosdb.github.io/">KairosDB</a>.
  Using Cassandra, you can store almost an indefinite amount of data as long as
  you are willing to <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/11/benchmarking-cassandra-scalability-on.html">spend the hardware</a> on it.

</p>

<h3>Metadata</h3>

<p>
  We use Elasticsearch to store and make metadata available to a heroic
  cluster. It is the primary component that drives Heroic's <a ui-sref="^.query_language">Query Language</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Elasticsearch has been <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/323-call-me-maybe-elasticsearch-1-5-0">shown to not be reliable in terms of data safety</a>.
  Because of this, Heroic uses Elasticsearch in a way so that it is not the primary storage and can rapidly be rebuilt.
</p>

  For more information, see the section detailing how to configure <a ui-sref="^.config.metadata">metadata backends</a>.
</p>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>
  When building Heroic it was quickly realized that navigating millions, or hundreads of millions of time series without context is hard.
  To address this, a specialized Elasticsearch backend was built to handle <a ui-sref="^.config.suggest">suggestions</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Suggestions provide information about what tags are available for a specific context.
  Assuming you are interested in which <code>what</code> tags exist for a given role, you could do the following:
</p>

<codeblock language="bash">
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" &lt;url&gt;/metadata/suggest-tag -d \
  '{"filter": ["=", "role", "heroic"], "key": "what", "value": "us"}'
</codeblock>

<codeblock language="json">
{
  "suggestions": [
    {"score": "1.0", "key": "what", "value": "cpu-usage"},
    {"score": "1.0", "key": "what", "value": "disk-used-percentage"}
  ]
}
</codeblock>

<p>
  Take note on the partial matching of <code>us</code> in <code>cpu-usage</code> and <code>disk-used-percentage</code>.
  This is the point of suggestions, to provide the user with the most relevant matches for a specific input.
  Especially partial ones.
  A typical use-case would be to fill the content of drop-down box as the user is typing.
</p>

<p>
  Suggestions are different from Metadata since it uses more intensive indexing techniques to analyze your tags.
  Having it as a separate module is useful since they are not critical to the operation of Heroic.
  Or to be more specific, its <a ui-sref="^.query_language">Query Language</a>.
</p>

<h3>Clustering and Federation</h3>

<p>
  Main article: <a ui-sref="^.federation">Federated Clusters</a>
</p>

<p>
  Heroic has support for federating requests, which allows multiple independent
  Heroic clusters to serve clients through a single global interface.
  This can be used to reduce the amount of geographical traffic by allowing one
  cluster to operate completely isolated within its zone.
