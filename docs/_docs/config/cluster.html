<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>
  Cluster configuration is located in the <code>cluster</code> section of the configuration.
</p>

<p>
  A typical configuration looks something like this.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
cluster:
  tags:
    site: london
  protocols:
    - type: grpc
  capabilities:
    - QUERY
  discovery:
    type: static
    nodes:
      - "grpc://heroic-stockholm-a"
      - "grpc://heroic-stockholm-b"
      - "grpc://heroic-london-a"
      - "grpc://heroic-london-b"
</code></pre>

<h3 id="tags">
  <code>tags</code>
  <a class="link-to" href="{{ page.short_url }}#tags"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
site: london
</code></pre>

<p>
  Defines a set of tags that identifies which part of the cluster this node belongs to.
  It's defined as an object like <code language="json">{"site": "london"}</code>.
  Nodes that have an identical set of tags are said to be part of the same <em>shard</em>.
  See the <a ui-sref="^.^.federation">federation</a> section for more details.
</p>

<h3><code>protocols</code></h3>

<p>
  Contains a list of protocols that this node can speak.
</p>

<h4>grpc</h4>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
host: &lt;host&gt;
port: &lt;port&gt;
</code></pre>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td><code>host</code></td>
    <td>the address of the interface that this node will bind to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>port</code></td>
    <td>the port number that this node will bind to.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
    <a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC</a> is an open source RPC protocol.
</p>

<h4>nativerpc</h4>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
host: &lt;host&gt;
port: &lt;port&gt;
</code></pre>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td><code>host</code></td>
    <td>the address of the interface that this node will bind to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>port</code></td>
    <td>the port number that this node will bind to.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  nativerpc is a protocol specifically designed to combat timeout and keep-alive issues that exists in HTTP.
  A TCP connection might decide to stall for arbitrary periods of time, and most HTTP clients have a hard time detecting if this happens <em>after</em> a request has been received by the server.
</p>

<p>
  A typical HTTP client supports two times of timeouts, <em>connection</em> and <em>read</em>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>connection</em> timeout is typically the time it takes to establish an open TCP connection.</li>
  <li>The <em>read</em> timeout is typically the time it takes to send and receive a response from the remote server.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A common error scenario arises when a client cannot predict how long a request will be running for.
  Given that we are dealing with cross-site traffic this is very bad, because a broken flow will leave the client hanging until it triggers its <em>read</em> timeout.
</p>

<p>
  <b>nativerpc</b> solves this by using <em>heartbeats</em>.
  The client communicates at which interval it expects to receive heartbeats, and as long as the server is actively processing the request it is expected to keep sending them.
</p>

<p>
  This simple mechanism allows the client to detect broken flows, regardless of cause.
  And allows the request to fail faster than what is permitted by HTTP.
</p>

<h3><code>capabilities</code></h3>

<p>
  This is a list of capabilities that is supported by this node.
  Capabilities restrict what other nodes perceive this node to be capable of doing.
  The current set of capabilities available right now are.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>QUERY</code> - the node is capable of receiving queries, this needs to be set if you intend for this node to receive queries over the cluster.</li>
  <li><code>WRITE</code> - the node is capable of receiving writes, this needs to be set if you intend for this node to receive writes over the cluster.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>discovery</code></h3>

<p>
  The mechanism used to discover nodes in the cluster.
</p>

<h4>static</h4>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
nodes:
  - &lt;url&gt;
  - ..
</code></pre>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>nodes</th>
    <td>
      Is the list of nodes that this node will attempt to add to its cluster registry.
      A valid url has the form <code>protocol://host[:port]</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Static is the simplest possible form of discovery.

  It takes a list of nodes that may, or may not be reachable at the moment.

  This list will be queried at a given interval, and any that responds to a metadata request will be added to the local list of known members.
</p>
