<p>
  A <span class="status">503</span> will still return a response body, however the root key <code>.ok</code> will have the value <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The below document shows that there is something wrong with the configured consumers, in this case it is because the number of <code>consumingThreads</code> is not the same as the <code>totalThreads</code>
</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">
  {
    "ok": false,
    "consumers": {
      "ok": false,
      "available": 0,
      "ready": 0,
      "errors": 0,
      "consumingThreads": 0,
      "totalThreads": 1
    },
    ...
  }
</code></pre>
