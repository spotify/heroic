  This section of the documentation will cover how to <a href="docs/getting_started/compile">compile</a>, <a href="docs/getting_started/installation">install</a>, and <a href="docs/getting_started/configuration">configure</a> Heroic.
  It will take us from nothing, to a running <em>experimental</em> system.

  Heroic as a project is still in an <b>Alpha</b> stage, use at your own risk,
  and if you find the time to, please <a href="https://github.com/spotify/heroic/">contribute</a>.
