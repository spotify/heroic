title: Configuring Suggestions
---
<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>
  The ability to perform suggestions is an important usability feature.
  It makes the difference for your system to be a complete black box, to giving your developers the ability to find and make use of time series on their own.
  Suggests are fairly expensive in terms of data storage and indexing operations. As each tag that is part of a metric is indexed. 
</p>

<p>
  Suggestions is an optional feature of heroic.
</p>

<p>
  This section will document how suggestions are configured in heroic.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
suggest:
  backends:
    - type: elasticsearch
      connection:
        index:
          type: rotating
          pattern: heroic-a-%s
</code></pre>


<p>
  <b>WARNINGS</b> There are ElasticSearch settings and mappings that must be configured before indexing operations are processed. These are required to make the reads efficient. At Spotify
  these settings are added when setting up the ElasticSearch cluster with Puppet.

  settings/mappings are here</a>
</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td><code>backends</code></td>
    <td>A list of suggest backend configurations</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>defaultBackends</code></td>
    <td>
      A list of backend group names that are part of the default group.
      The default group is the group of backends that are used for operations unless a specified group is used.
      The default behavior is to include <em>all configured backends</em> in the default group.

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td><code>type</code></td>
    <td><code>"elasticsearch"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>id</code></td>
    <td>
      Specify which id this backend has that is used to uniquely identify this backend.
      If not specified, the id will be generated.
    </td>

    <td>
      Specify which group, or list groups, this backend should be part of.

    <td><code>connection</code></td>
    <td>
      An elasticsearch connection specification.

      The number of writes this backend allows per second before rate-limiting kicks in.

    <td><code>writeCacheDurationMinutes</code></td>
    <td>
      The number of minutes a write will be cached for.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td><code>templateName</code></td>
    <td>
      Default name of the template that will be configured in elasticsearch for this backend.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td><code>backendType</code></td>
    <td>
      Which backend configuration to use, has an effect on the schema and how tags are accessed.
      Currently, the following types are available.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>v1</b> - which is the first generation backend schema.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>kv</b> - a backend type based of a flattening the key-value context into a single array.
          We've shown that it is more efficient, but have to support both since some users rely on the first generation schema.
        </li>
      </ul>
