title: Configuring Metadata
---
<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>
  Metadata acts as the index to time series data, it is the driving force behind our <a href="docs/query_language">Query Language</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Metadata resolution is important since it allows operators to specify a subset of known metadata, and resolve it into a set of matching time series.
  Without metadata, the burden of keeping track of time series would lie solely in the client.
</p>

<p>
  A typical metadata configuration could look like the following.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
metadata:
  backends:
    - type: elasticsearch
      connection:
        index:
          type: rotating
          pattern: heroic-a-%s
</code></pre>

<p>
  <b>WARNINGS</b> There are ElasticSearch settings and mappings that must be configured before indexing operations are processed. These are required to make the reads efficient. At Spotify
  these settings are added when setting up the ElasticSearch cluster with Puppet.

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td><code>backends</code></td>
    <td>A list of metadata backend configurations</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>defaultBackends</code></td>
    <td>
      A list of backend group names that are part of the default group.
      The default group is the group of backends that are used for operations unless a specified group is used.
      The default behaviour is to include <em>all configured backends</em> in the default group.

      An elasticsearch connection specification.

      The number of writes this backend allows per second before rate-limiting kicks in.

    <td>
      The number of minutes a write will be cached for.

  <tr>
    <td><code>templateName</code></td>
    <td>
      Default name of the template that will be configured in elasticsearch for this backend.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td><code>backendType</code></td>
    <td>
      Which backend configuration to use, has an effect on the schema and how tags are accessed.
      Currently, the following types are available.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>v1</b> - which is the first generation backend schema.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>kv</b> - a backend type based of a flattening the key-value context into a single array.
          We've shown that it is more efficient, but have to support both since some users rely on the first generation schema.
        </li>
