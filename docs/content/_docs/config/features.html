<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>
  Features are a way to modify the behaviour of your service.
  They are implemented as flags namespaced to heroic, an example would be:
  <code>com.spotify.heroic.shift_range</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Features can be configured either on a per-query basis, or in the
  configuration section <code>features</code> to apply it to all queries by
  default.
  They can either be enabled or disabled. To enable a flag, you specify its
  name. To disable it, you specify it's name prefixed with a minux sign
  <code>-&lt;name&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Precedence is defined as the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Query</li>
  <li>Configuration</li>
  <li>Default</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is applied for any given feature flag.
  If omitted in one stage, it will be looked up in another.
</p>

<p>
  A typical configuration looks something like this.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
features:
  - com.spotify.heroic.shift_range
  - -com.spotify.heroic.distributed_aggregations
</code></pre>

<p>
  When added to a query, they are added to the <code>.features</code> section
  like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  "features": [
    "com.spotify.heroic.shift_range",
    "-com.spotify.heroic.distributed_aggregations"
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<div class="callout callout-danger">
  <h4>This section can quickly become out of date</h4>
  <p>
    For the source of truth, look at the Feature class in heroic:
    <a git-href-java="heroic-component">com.spotify.heroic.common.Feature</a>
  </p>
</div>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Default</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>com.spotify.heroic.distributed_aggregations</code></td>
    <td>
      Enable feature to perform distributed aggregations.
      Aggregations are commonly performed per-shard, and the result
      concatenated. This enables experimental support for distributed
      aggregations which behave transparently across shards.
      Typically this will cause more data to be transported across shards for
      each request.

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>com.spotify.heroic.shift_range</code></td>
    <td>
      Enable feature to cause range to be rounded on the current cadence.
      This will assert that there are data outside of the range queried for and
      that the range is aligned to the queried cadence.
      Which is a useful feature when using a dashboarding system.
