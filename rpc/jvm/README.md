# JVM RPC for Heroic

This module allows multiple Heroic instances to communicate with each other if
they are on the same JVM.
This is only used for integration testing.

For an example of this, see the
[AbstractLocalClusterIT](/heroic-dist/src/test/java/com/spotify/heroic/AbstractLocalClusterIT.java) test
suite.
